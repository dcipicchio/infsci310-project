# infsci310-project

### Used nbastatR to get players for the two CSVs:
### Modern Players: Players included either began playing during the 2010s or played through the 2009-2010 season.
### Older Players: Players included either began playing during the 1980s or played through the 1979-1980 season.

### CSVs were trimmed based on 3 statistics: Games Played - Excluded players with less than 400 games, Minutes Per Game - Excluded players who played the less than 15 mins per game, Win Share(statistic that attempts to split credit for a team's success to indiviuals on the team) - Excluded players with a win share of less than 40.
